## The use of a .gitignore file within each project
Gitignore specifies which files and directories should be ignored and not tracked by Git so as to manage source control.

## The storage of credentials and sensitive information explained
Storing credentials and sensitive information securely is crucial to protecting sensitive data.
Just by making your repository and projects private, gitHub allows you to control who can access and modify your repositories.
They are also tools like Gitignore. GitHub also provides a feature called "GitHub Secrets" for storing and managing sensitive information.
